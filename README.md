Script files connected to Frans, Braeken, Veldkamp &amp; Paap (2022) - Empirical Priors in Polytomous CATs: Risks and Rewards in Clinical Settings

This repository contains three R scripts that were used to simulate the different scenarios in the Empirical Priors in Polytomous CATs: Risks and Rewards in Clinical Settings paper published in Applied Psychological Measurement. Simulation1_polyCAT_github.R: Was used for the simulation study 1 Simulation2_polyCAT_github: Was used for the simulation study 2 run_local2.R: Contains a function from the mirtCAT package (by Phil Chalmers) that was modified to allow varying prior precision at the initialization of the CAT

As well as two data files that are used in the second simulation coef_AMPD.Rdata: contains item parameters of the item bank used in the simulation study 2 Table_3: contains a frequency table of global scores and theta values (Table 3 in the paper)
